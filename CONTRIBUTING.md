## Getting Started

- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
    - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

- Create a fork from where you want to base your work.
    - This is usually the master branch.
    - Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
    - This is usually the master branch.
    - To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b fix/master/my_contribution master`.
    - Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
